# VR 3D Model

I created a THREEjs project that allows you to view the 3D model from all sides. The project will allow you to move zoom in and out using the mouse or trackpad using OrbitControlsjs file. The purpose of this project was to learn how to load GTLF models within THREEjs using the GTLFLoader.js file.
